Welcome to the first post on my new site! 👋
I guess I will use this post to tell a bit about how this site was made.
You can find the source code in its [Github repo](https://github.com/kasperlaursen/kasperlaursen.github.io). 🎉

### 💿 Technologies

The site is build using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwindcss](http://tailwindcss.com).
Posts are written as Markdown files, which are parsed by [next-mdx-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-mdx-remote) and [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter).

Gray matter is used to get metadata from the top of the file:

### Technologies

```

The main content of the file is parsed using next-md-remote, and then styled using [@tailwindcss/typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography).
To make the posts work with dark mode I used [nightwind](https://github.com/jjranalli/nightwind).

### 🌐 Deployment

The page is deployed to Github Pages using [a Github Action](https://github.com/kasperlaursen/kasperlaursen.github.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/intergrate.yml) that builds a static version of the site and commits the /out dir to a separate branch in the repository.

### 📖 Resources

To get started I watched [How To Build A Blog With Next.js And Tailwind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu9gPcPs3mY) by [Harry Wolff](https://www.youtube.com/c/hswolff/videos) on Youtube.

From the beginning, I changed the project to Typescript by following the steps from [the next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript).

Tailwindcss has documentation on how to install Tailwind in a Next.js project [on their site](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

For Icons, I use [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons).

Dark mode is accomplished with Tailwinds default dark: prefix, and [nightwind](https://github.com/jjranalli/nightwind).
The darkmode toggle was **heavely inspired** (copied) from [TailwindComponents.com](https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/switch).

To figure out the Github Pages stuff I found [this article](https://dev.to/franciscojarceo/deploying-a-next-js-site-using-github-actions-1g1e) helpful.

**To make Github Pages work you need to name the repository {username}.github.io**, or set up a custom domain. - More info can be found on this [Github issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/2029).
